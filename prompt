Create well-formed git commit message based of off the currently staged file
contents. The message should convey why something was changed and not what
changed. Use the well known format that has the prefix chore, fix, etc. 
And don't capitalize first letter in commit message

Only include changes to source files for the programming languages, shell configurations files,
documentation such as readme and other .mds, and any changes to package management file.
Exclude any lock or sum files.

Do not use markdown format for the output.

For the first line of the commit message, this must be constrained to 40 characters as a
maximum and use additional lines for any further context.
